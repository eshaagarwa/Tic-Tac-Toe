🛠️ **Tic-Tac-Toe Java Game**: Play, Learn, and Enjoy! 🛠️

🎉 Hey there! I’m excited to present my **Tic-Tac-Toe** project, a simple and interactive Java game that brings the classic childhood game to life 💻. Whether you’re just learning **Java** or want to have some fun, this project will give you an understanding of how to create interactive games using basic programming concepts and logic 🎮.

🚀 **Project Features Overview** 🚀

🎮 **Game Highlights** 🎮
- **2-Player Mode**: Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe with another player on the same system.
- **Board Display**: A visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board is displayed to the user after every move.
- **Turn Tracking**: The program keeps track of whose turn it is, and it alternates between the two players.
- **Win/Lose/Draw Conditions**: After each move, the program checks for a win, loss, or draw and declares the result accordingly.

🛠️ **Core Concepts Used** 🛠️
This project uses basic **Java concepts** like:
- **2D Arrays**: To represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- **Loops & Conditionals**: For turn-taking, checking win conditions, and updating the board.
- **User Input**: The game takes input from users to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on the board.
  
📜 **Main Algorithms & Files** 📜
- **TicTacToe.java**: Contains the entire code logic, from initializing the board to checking for the winner and handling turns.

🛠️ **Technologies Used** 🛠️
- **Java**: The core programming language used to develop the game.
- **Arrays**: To hold and manipulate game data (the board and player moves).

🚀 **Requirements** 🚀
- **IDE**: You can run the project on any IDE like **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**, or **VSCode**.
- **Java Knowledge**: Basic knowledge of Java programming and **arrays** will help you understand the code structure.
- **Command Line**: The game runs directly in the command-line interface, making it easy to play and test.

🌟 **How to Play & Explore** 🌟
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/eshaagarwa/Tic-Tac-Toe.git`
2. **Run the project**: Open `TicTacToe.java` in your IDE or compile and run it through the terminal.
3. **Have fun playing!** Take turns placing your marks and see who wins!
